## 2. Extension: Pose_Vis - SDG 3 Bounding Box Viewer
The 3D Pose Visualizer extension built on top of the "SDG 2D bounding box metadata viewer extension" (from Scott Dempsey (Sirens))

This tool allows users to:
- Visualize 3D poses of objects using bounding boxes projected onto images.
- Dynamically display objects' metadata, such as class and visibility.
- Interact with an intuitive UI for navigating through frames.
